This document is to explain how to run the code for the project 5. 
The file is a Jupyter note book file with python 3.6 version. We 
recommend to use Anaconda Navigator python 3.6 version to run the 
code. All the dataset files are required to be in the same 
folder with all the other codes in order to run the program. Moreover,
It is important to change some of the code to direct the program find
the right path of data files. All necessary change can be found in 
comment of the code.

1-	The python codes were separate by parts. The folder label 1.1 
	contains the code for problem 1.1, The folder label 1.2 & 1.3 
	contains the code for problem 1.2 & 1.3. One can run the code from
	top to bottom to see the results.
	
2-	The codes labeled with "proj5_p1_1.4" and "proj5_p1_1.4" contains the
	code for 1.4 and 1.5. A special note for code 1.4. It requires a
	powerful machine with large memory to get the final result since it 
	automatically yields all the result for part 1.4.
	
3- 	The codes labeled with "proj5_p2" and "proj5_p2" contains codes for
	part 2 and part 3. One can run the code from top to bottom to see the 
	results.
