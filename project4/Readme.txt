This document is to explain how to run the code for the project 4. 
The file is a Jupyter note book file with python 3.6 version. We 
recommend to use Anaconda Navigator python 3.6 version to run the 
code. "network_backup_dataset.csv" file is required to be in the same 
folder with all the other codes in order to run the program.

1-	The python codes were separate by parts. The code label with 
	"Project4_PartA" which contains the code for part A are written
	in python 3.6 version. The code can be run from top to bottom by 
	cell in order. And the result will show automatically. 
	
2-	The code labeled with "Project4_PartB", "Project4_PartC", 
	"Project4_PartD" and "Project4_PartE" which contain the codes for 
	part B to Part E have the same properties as code part A. And it can 
	be run from top to bottom in order. 
	
3- 	For code part B, it involves showing a decision tree at the last step,
	and it requires "graphviz" library and a default ".png" browser.
